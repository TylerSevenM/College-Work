    <h2 id="p1aboutme">About Me</h2>
	<p>Hi, I'm Tyler, I'm 21 years old and 1/8th Native American! This portion comes from my biological mother's side, which, I'm adopted so I do not know her. The family I was adopted by is an extension of my biological father's family so I never really feel far from home. All of this happened when I was very young so I grew up knowing I was adopted but not in a painful way, my mother has always been my mother.  <p>
	<p>I've always been very interested in video games since I was very little but it wasn't until after my karate phase when I started to really get into them. When I was 11 years old I competed at a Taekwondo tournament in three different activities. In two of these three, I placed first! Around 13 I became a second degree black belt in Taekwondo and I was projected to quickly advance into a third degree; however, there was a rule that prevented me from being able to receive my next rank until I was 18 years old. This was really demoralizing and so I focused my attention towards video games and I've used them as a fairly unhealthy couping mechanism since!<p>
	<h2 id="p1HandI">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
	<p>My primary hobby is playing video games and dissecting them to play them at the highest possible level, competitively. During highschool this was CS:GO and sometimes League of Legends. I'm a big fan of FPS games and they have been, on average, the games I'm better at and achieve higher ranks in. One of the best parts about this is being able to make really cool manuevers and the fact that those skills are very fluid, they translate well from game to game (of the same type). Some of my other interests are binge watching shows, reading, finding delicious tea to drink and learning about space or physics.<p>
	<p>I'm incredibly interested in music, especially sound combinations that are very appealing - this can range from classical all the way to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music" target="_blank">electronic</a>. This pretty much means I like any type of music but I'm very picky about the actual sound of the song. Generally I try to stick within certain genres like pop, rap, rock, alternative rock and such but it is easy to find me listening to other material. At the moment I'm currently obsessed with the band Starset, their music is very appealing as it is both energetic in lyrics and laid back in beat. Not to mention, that, they also cover topics I feel strongly about in a way that I strongly resonate with.<p>
	<h2 id="p1Edu">Education</h2>
	<p>In highschool I did dual-enrollment at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Johns_River_State_College" target="_blank">SJRSC</a> so, in extension to <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Florida" target="_blank">UNF</a>, I've completed schooling at multiple places. Most of my classes in highschool were AP classes leaving me with a pretty solid GPA. If only I had gotten two more A's than B's in classes where I was given the opportunity, I would've graduated summa cum laude. I was only a few decimal points off and it was probably one of the more disappointing events from high school besides high school itself.<p>
	<p>After graduation, I immediately enrolled in UNF to continue my education journey and now I'm graduating early (about three years of college for my degree) and I feel very unready. I'm still undecided as to when I will go for my masters or PhD but they're certainly something I intend to achieve in my life. I'm still unsure what I wish to study even though I have a degree coming very shortly and that worries me but I still have plenty of time to figure out what I want to do, so, I take solice in that.</p>
