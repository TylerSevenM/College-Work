So this is my attempt at project 5. It has some bugs but most of the stuff that works,
just works, at least for my testing. This project is an immediate code generator. I really tried 
hard to make it look very readable for the parts it is capable of reading. The full scope of the project
was not able to be complete due to time constraints from other classes. Other classes (due to remote
nature of the classes (covid19)) decide they would add a lot more work suddenly right at the end 
when I was already trying to study for finals.
