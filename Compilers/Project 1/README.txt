My program works by taking preset arraylists and then comparing the current
characters against them in conditional checks.

It then appends each character to an ongoing global string as it checks
for either Symbol, Number, or Letter status.

Inside these "statuses" it will manipulate and append at the discretion
of the conditionals. Under the right conditions it will then go to an
Identify() method that is a void and will manipulate the global string
that has characters constantly appended by it.
