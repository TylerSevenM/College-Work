To run the program you have to first prime it in terminal, 
use the following commands:

100
30
env3
alg3

This produces a 100 by 100 board with 30% density,
environment 3 is just the random sample board and should
remain unchanged. Alg3 is the final project ARA* implementation

Press "spacebar" to launch program into action.
Press "backspace" to shuffle board (with new conditionals too)
